Unreleased
----------

Added:

- Nothing yet

`2-1-0`_ - 2017-04-18
---------------------

Fixed:

- Fixed incorrect comparison PolygonalROI mask_points that resulted in an incorrect mask
- Point bounds are now giben for a grid scan in a rectangular region

Changed:

- Use numpy import when running in Jython instead of "numjy"

`2-0-0`_ - 2017-03-17
---------------------

Added:

- Adds dependency on numpy
- Added Dimension class, providing points along a dataset dimension
- Add dimensions attribute to CompoundGenerator
- Add shape attribute to CompoundGenerator
- Jython builds using a numpy emulator are tested
- Add ROIExcluder, replacing previous use of Excluder (now a generic base class)

Changed:

- Rewrite Generator mechanisms to use vectorised operations for point calculation
- Generators now only usable through CompoundGenerator
- CompoundGenerator requires call to prepare before use
- CompoundGenerator now takes a duration argument, replacing FixedDurationMutator (removed)
- Rename name/names to axes in Generators
- Rename scannables to axes in Excluders
- Generators take an array for units with the same size as axes
- Rename num_points to size and num_lobes to lobes in LissajousGenerator
- PolygonalROI takes separate x,y arrays for its vertices
- Bounds are only applied to the innermost axis/axes
- Remove index_names and index_dims from Generators
- License changed to Eclipse Public License v1.0
