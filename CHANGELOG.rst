`Unreleased`_
-------------

`3-1`_ - 2020-01-27
-------------------

Added:

- CompoundGenerator.get_points(), optimized for consuming scans chunk by chunk

`3-0`_ - 2019-11-14
-------------------

Added:

- ZipGenerator
- ConcatGenerator
- delay_after argument to CompoundGenerator

Changed:

- LineGenerator single points case puts point in centre of start/stop
- Licence changed back to Apache License 2.0
- excluders and mutator arguments to CompoundGenerator default to []
- Dimensions may contain alternating and non-alternating generators, but in some
  complex cases this may change the order that generators are executed. See #68


`2-3`_ - 2019-08-09
-------------------

Added:

- New get_mesh_map function to Dimension class to get mesh indices
- Squashing Excluder

Changed:

- Made ArrayGenerator backwards compatible by handling 'axis' init argument
- RandomOffsetMutator to take array of floats instead of dict for max offset arg
- StaticPointGenerator to take an optional axes argument for a single axis
- Gave CompoundGenerator mutators and excluders defaults of ()
- Now requires typing module

Fixed:

- Various annotypes fixes

`2-2-1`_ - 2019-03-28
---------------------

Fixed:

- DLS specific build changes for setuptools multi-version

`2-2`_ - 2019-03-21
-------------------

Changed:

- Converted Generators, Excluders, Mutators, and ROIS to use annotypes
- Removed python 3.3 and 3.4 from travis build, and added 3.6
- Updated to annotypes 0.13 to bring in sphinx extension for documentation

`2-1-1`_ - 2018-04-30
---------------------

Added:

- Tags now cause Travis to deploy to PyPi

Fixed:

- Fixed plotgenerator to interpolate turnarounds properly 

`2-1-0`_ - 2017-04-18
---------------------

Fixed:

- Fixed incorrect comparison PolygonalROI mask_points that resulted in an incorrect mask
- Point bounds are now giben for a grid scan in a rectangular region

Changed:

- Use numpy import when running in Jython instead of "numjy"

`2-0-0`_ - 2017-03-17
---------------------

Added:

- Adds dependency on numpy
- Added Dimension class, providing points along a dataset dimension
- Add dimensions attribute to CompoundGenerator
- Add shape attribute to CompoundGenerator
- Jython builds using a numpy emulator are tested
- Add ROIExcluder, replacing previous use of Excluder (now a generic base class)

Changed:

- Rewrite Generator mechanisms to use vectorised operations for point calculation
- Generators now only usable through CompoundGenerator
- CompoundGenerator requires call to prepare before use
- CompoundGenerator now takes a duration argument, replacing FixedDurationMutator (removed)
- Rename name/names to axes in Generators
- Rename scannables to axes in Excluders
- Generators take an array for units with the same size as axes
- Rename num_points to size and num_lobes to lobes in LissajousGenerator
- PolygonalROI takes separate x,y arrays for its vertices
- Bounds are only applied to the innermost axis/axes
- Remove index_names and index_dims from Generators
